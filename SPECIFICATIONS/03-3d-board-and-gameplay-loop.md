# Phase 3: 3D board + gameplay loop

## Phase overview

**Phase number:** 3
**Phase name:** 3D board + gameplay loop (v0.1 ships at the end of this phase)
**Estimated timeframe:** 7–10 days
**Dependencies:** Phase 1 (scaffolding), Phase 2 (engine + AI).

**Brief description:**
Wire the engine + AI from Phase 2 into a playable web UI. Build the menu page, rules page, and game page, render the 3D board with `@react-three/fiber`, animate moves and captures, and connect the AI turn loop. At the end of this phase, **v0.1 is shippable**: a complete, anonymous, single-player Hnefatafl game runs at `hnefatafl.hultberg.org`. No accounts, no leaderboard, no persistence beyond an in-memory anonymous-games counter (the persisted version lands in Phase 4).

## Scope and deliverables

### In scope

**App shell:**
- [ ] State-machine SPA router (`AppView` type, no react-router) ported from the prototype. Views relevant to v0.1: `menu`, `game`, `rules`, `privacy`. (Other views — leaderboard, profile, sign-in, admin, contact — render placeholder "coming soon" panels for v0.1.)
- [ ] Parchment palette applied across the app (matches prototype Tailwind config + custom CSS variables).
- [ ] Cinzel + Cormorant Garamond fonts wired up.

**Menu page:**
- [ ] Title, subtitle, "Play" button, difficulty selector (Thrall/Karl/Jarl), side selector (defender/attacker — prototype calls this "Choose your side").
- [ ] Anonymous-games counter at the bottom — for v0.1 this is in-memory only (resets per page load) **OR** a simple `/api/stats/anonymous-games` endpoint that reads from KV. Pick the KV-backed option: it's a few hours of work and gives v0.1 an honest visible signal that real users are playing.
- [ ] Links to Rules, Privacy.

**Game page:**
- [ ] 3D board rendered by `Board3D` component (port `Board3D.tsx` from prototype, ~874 lines).
- [ ] Ornate piece style (`OrnatePiece` from prototype, lathe-geometry, ~290 lines). Textured style is **deferred to Phase 7** — for v0.1 we ship ornate-only.
- [ ] Camera positioned at `[0, 12, ±10]` flipped by side.
- [ ] Click-to-select piece, click-to-move (only legal moves highlighted). Cancel selection by clicking elsewhere.
- [ ] AI turn loop: after the player moves, the AI thinks (with the documented 300/500/800ms simulated delay added in the React hook, not in the AI module itself), then animates its move.
- [ ] Move animation: 700ms slide.
- [ ] Capture animation: three-phase (pop / topple / sink-and-fade).
- [ ] Game status panel (whose turn, captured pieces count, move count, elapsed time).
- [ ] Game-over dialog when win condition met. Shows winner, duration, move count. "New game" returns to menu.

**Rules page:**
- [ ] Static page describing Copenhagen ruleset, board, pieces, movement, captures, win conditions. Port text from the prototype's `RulesPage.tsx`.

**Privacy page:**
- [ ] Static page. For v0.1, copy the prototype's text but with a note that accounts/data are not yet in play — adjust again in v0.2.

**Hooks:**
- [ ] `useGame` hook: holds `GameState`, exposes `selectPiece`, `move`, `newGame`, `aiTurn`. Handles AI think delay (300/500/800ms by difficulty) and animation timing.
- [ ] `usePieceStyle` hook: reads `localStorage` key `hnefatafl-piece-style`, defaults to `ornate`. For v0.1 only `ornate` is valid; `textured` is rejected with a fallback to ornate.

**Worker side:**
- [ ] `/api/stats/anonymous-games` endpoint:
  - [ ] `GET` returns `{count: number}` from KV.
  - [ ] `POST` increments the counter by 1. Rate-limited per IP (see "Edge cases" below).
- [ ] Worker integration test for both endpoints.

**Tests:**
- [ ] Unit tests for hooks (`useGame`, `usePieceStyle`).
- [ ] Integration tests for game flow: pick side+difficulty → play to a known endgame → assert game-over dialog appears with correct outcome.
- [ ] Worker tests for the anonymous-games endpoint, including the rate limiter.
- [ ] 3D component tests stay light (rendering 3D under jsdom is painful) — visual regression deferred; manual checklist used instead.

### Out of scope
- Textured piece style — Phase 7.
- Accounts, leaderboard, profile, admin, contact — placeholder views only.
- Persisted per-user game results — Phase 4.
- Sound effects.
- Multiplayer.
- Save/load mid-game.

### Acceptance criteria
- [ ] You can land on `hnefatafl.hultberg.org`, click Play, pick Thrall + defender, play a full game, win or lose, see the game-over dialog, click "New game", play again.
- [ ] All three AI difficulties (Thrall, Karl, Jarl) playable and feel distinct.
- [ ] Both sides (defender, attacker) playable.
- [ ] Capture animations look correct (three-phase pop/topple/sink).
- [ ] Move animations are 700ms and feel smooth at 60fps on a typical laptop.
- [ ] No console errors during a complete game.
- [ ] Anonymous-games counter increments after each game completes and persists across page reloads.
- [ ] Rules page renders with correct content.
- [ ] Mobile responsive: playable on a phone-sized viewport (camera/zoom may need adjustment per the prototype).
- [ ] All Phase 3 tests pass; coverage ≥95% on `src/client/hooks/**` and `src/client/state/**` (3D component coverage is lower by necessity).

## Technical approach

### Architecture decisions

**Port `Board3D` largely verbatim, then prune**
- Choice: Bring `Board3D.tsx`, `OrnatePiece.tsx`, `GameStatus.tsx`, `GameOverDialog.tsx`, and `PlayerIdentity.tsx` over from the prototype as a starting point. Adjust import paths and the engine API binding. Delete textured-piece code paths (deferred to Phase 7).
- Rationale: The 3D code is well-tuned and reproducing it from scratch risks subtle regressions (camera angles, lighting, piece geometry). Port-then-prune is faster and more faithful.
- Alternatives considered: Rewriting from scratch with cleaner abstractions. Rejected — not enough upside, real downside risk.

**State-machine router, not react-router**
- Choice: Single `AppView` union type with `useState`; navigation by setState.
- Rationale: Matches the prototype. The app has very few views and they're not deep-linkable in v0.1 (no `/leaderboard/123` style URLs needed yet). A library would be overkill.
- Alternatives considered: react-router-dom (overkill for v0.1). May revisit in v1.0 if we want shareable URLs for leaderboard/profile pages.

**AI think delay belongs to the hook, not the AI module**
- Choice: `getAIMove` in `src/shared/game/ai.ts` returns instantly. The 300/500/800ms simulated thinking pause is added in `useGame` via `setTimeout`.
- Rationale: Keeps the AI module pure (Phase 2 acceptance criterion). UX timing is a presentation concern. Also future-proofs server-side AI invocation — if we ever validate a game replay server-side, we don't want fake delays in the loop.

**KV for the anonymous-games counter, with per-IP rate limit**
- Choice: Use KV with a single counter key. Rate-limit the `POST /api/stats/anonymous-games` endpoint to 10 increments per IP per hour, also in KV (TTL'd keys).
- Rationale: Avoids someone spamming the counter from a bot. 10/hour is generous for legitimate play (a real game takes minutes); anything beyond that is abuse.
- Alternatives considered: D1 row with a counter (heavier than KV, no real benefit). Atomically incrementing via Durable Object (overkill at this scale; KV read-then-write is fine — eventual consistency on a vanity counter is acceptable).

### Technology choices

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `@react-three/fiber` | 3D rendering |
| `@react-three/drei` | helpers (`OrbitControls`, `Plane`, etc.) |
| `three` | underlying 3D library |
| `@radix-ui/react-dialog` (via shadcn) | game-over dialog |

No new framework decisions; everything is consistent with Phase 1's stack.

**Files to modify:**
- `src/client/App.tsx` (created in Phase 1 as placeholder) — replace with state-machine router.
- `src/worker/index.ts` — register stats routes.
- `src/db/schema.ts` — still empty (no schema in Phase 3).

### Database schema changes
None. KV holds the counter and rate-limit buckets.

## Testing strategy

### Unit tests

**Coverage targets:** ≥95% lines/functions/statements on hooks and pure-logic modules. 3D components have lower coverage by nature; that's accepted.

**Key test files:**
- `useGame.test.ts` — selects pieces, executes moves, AI takes its turn after delay, game-over detection.
- `usePieceStyle.test.ts` — reads localStorage, defaults to ornate, rejects invalid values.
- `stats.test.ts` — GET returns counter, POST increments, POST rate-limited after 10 calls from the same IP, POST from a different IP is unaffected.
- `appView.test.ts` — view transitions are valid.

### Integration tests

- [ ] Playwright/headless test: load menu → click Play → pick Thrall + defender → play moves until king reaches corner → game-over dialog shows. **Optional for v0.1** — if Playwright adds too much CI overhead, defer to manual checklist.
- [ ] Worker integration: `POST /api/stats/anonymous-games` 11 times from the same IP, assert the 11th is rate-limited (429).

### Manual testing checklist

- [ ] Full game against Thrall as defender — wins occur, dialog correct.
- [ ] Full game against Karl as attacker — wins occur, dialog correct.
- [ ] Full game against Jarl as defender — wins occur, dialog correct.
- [ ] Camera angle flips correctly when switching sides.
- [ ] Capture animation plays for every capture type (custodial, shield wall).
- [ ] Game-over dialog shows correct winner / duration / move count.
- [ ] Anonymous-games counter increments after game completion and persists across reloads.
- [ ] Mobile viewport (375×667): board still readable, controls reachable.
- [ ] Tablet viewport (768×1024): board scales appropriately.
- [ ] Desktop (1440×900): default experience, no layout issues.
- [ ] Rules page renders all sections.
- [ ] No 3D rendering glitches (z-fighting, missing pieces, etc.).
- [ ] No console errors or warnings.

---

## Pre-commit checklist

- [ ] All Phase 3 tests passing
- [ ] Coverage thresholds met (≥95% on hooks + pure logic, branches ≥90% project-wide)
- [ ] Manual checklist completed at least once before opening the PR
- [ ] Type checking passes
- [ ] No `console.log` left in client code
- [ ] No `debugger` statements
- [ ] Lighthouse a11y score ≥90 on menu, game-page-during-play, rules, privacy
- [ ] Bundle size sane (under ~800KB gzip is the rough target; react-three-fiber pushes us up)
- [ ] No dependency on the prototype's `supabase` package — confirm it's not in `package.json`

## PR workflow

### Branch naming
`feature/phase-3-3d-and-gameplay`

### PR title
`Phase 3: 3D board + gameplay loop (v0.1)`

### Review requirements
- Run `/review-pr`. This phase is large but mostly contained to client + a small KV endpoint. Triage may land on **standard** or **team** — fine either way.
- Worth specifically asking the reviewer to look at: (a) the AI turn-loop timing in `useGame`, (b) the rate-limit logic in `stats.ts`, (c) any leftover Supabase imports from the verbatim port.

### Deployment steps
1. `wrangler deploy`.
2. Smoke-test menu → play → game-over dialog on production.
3. Smoke-test the anonymous-games counter increments.
4. Tag the deploy as `v0.1.0` once smoke tests pass.
5. Tell Magnus he can play.

## Edge cases and considerations

### Known risks

- **Rate-limit on anonymous counter:** without it, anyone can run `while true; do curl -X POST .../anonymous-games; done` and inflate the counter. **Mitigation:** documented above; KV-backed per-IP bucket, 10/hour. Failure mode if the bucket itself fails: increment is silently rejected (no harm). Surface a clear error in the worker test so this doesn't quietly break.

- **3D performance on low-end devices:** `@react-three/fiber` is fine on modern hardware but can chug on older phones. **Mitigation:** test on the lowest-spec phone Magnus has access to; if it's bad, reduce shadow/AA quality on mobile breakpoints.

- **Verbatim port carries Supabase imports:** the prototype's `useGame`/`useAuth` may reference `supabase`. **Mitigation:** delete or stub those imports during the port; CI will flag any leftover via type-check.

- **AI think-delay race condition:** if the user clicks "New game" mid-AI-turn, the AI's `setTimeout` might fire and try to apply a move to a fresh board. **Mitigation:** use an abort signal / mounted ref in `useGame`; tests should cover "interrupt mid-AI-turn".

- **`window.localStorage` access in SSR-style code:** even though we're not SSR, the test environment may need a polyfill. **Mitigation:** jsdom provides one out of the box; if not, mock in test setup.

### Performance considerations

- AI runs on the main thread; Karl/Jarl can hit ~80ms which is visible as a frame stutter. **Mitigation:** the simulated think-delay (300/500/800ms) covers this; the AI call is wrapped in a `setTimeout` so the browser breathes first.
- Capture animations should use `useFrame` from r3f, not React state updates per frame.

### Security considerations

- The anonymous-games counter is publicly writable (POST endpoint). Rate-limited per IP. Worst-case abuse: counter inflates faster than it should — visible nuisance, not a security incident.
- No authentication surface in this phase.

### Accessibility considerations

- 3D board is inherently visual. Provide a textual game status alongside the 3D rendering (whose turn, last move, captures) — already in the prototype.
- Keyboard support for piece movement is **out of scope for v0.1** — note as TD-002 below.
- All buttons (menu, dialog) keyboard-accessible.
- Colour contrast on parchment palette: confirm Cinzel text on parchment background meets WCAG AA.

### Future optimisation opportunities

- Move AI to a Web Worker so it doesn't block the main thread — would let us drop the simulated think delay and have the AI actually feel like it's thinking.
- Replace the simulated delay with real progress feedback ("Jarl is considering 12 moves…").
- Visual regression testing once the 3D output stabilises.

---

## Technical debt introduced

**TD-002: No keyboard navigation on the 3D board**
- **Location:** `src/client/components/game/Board3D.tsx`
- **Issue:** Piece selection and movement are mouse/touch only.
- **Why accepted:** Faithful port; the prototype has the same limitation. Building a fully keyboard-accessible 3D chess-like board is a project in itself.
- **Risk:** Medium for accessibility, low for project completion.
- **Future fix:** Post-v1.0 — overlay a 2D grid with keyboard focus management, mirroring the 3D state.

**TD-003: AI runs on main thread**
- **Location:** `src/client/hooks/useGame.ts`
- **Issue:** Karl/Jarl can stall a frame; masked by the simulated think delay.
- **Why accepted:** Web Worker integration is non-trivial and v0.1 is shippable without it.
- **Risk:** Low. Visible as occasional jank on low-end devices.
- **Future fix:** Wrap the AI module in a Web Worker; remove the simulated delay or shorten it.

## Notes

This phase ends with v0.1 shippable. After deploying, **tag the release `v0.1.0`** and pause for Magnus to actually play it for a few days before starting Phase 4. Feedback from those playthroughs will sharpen the Phase 4 scope (what stats matter? what was annoying? what should v0.2 prioritise?).

Resist scope creep here. Things like "while we're at it, let's add sound effects" or "let's get textured pieces in too" should be politely declined — those are out of scope and will block v0.1 shipping. The whole point of the milestone split is that v0.1 stays small.
